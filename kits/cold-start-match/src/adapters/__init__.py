"""SEAM 1 — the model. Swapping provider or model is .env plus the same run again.

THIS IS THE TEACHING POINT OF THE KIT, not the app above it. It makes one claim checkable that
everybody asserts and nobody demonstrates: swapping models is a one-line change, and knowing
whether you should is an eval run.

WHY RAW HTTP FOR EVERY PROVIDER, INCLUDING ANTHROPIC.
Each vendor ships an excellent official SDK, and for a single-vendor application you should use
it. This is not a single-vendor application. A forker runs this on whichever provider they already
hold a key for, so giving one vendor its SDK and the rest a hand-rolled client would bake a
preference into the exact file whose purpose is not having one -- and it would make `pip install`
pull a client for a vendor most forkers will never call. The wire format for a single completion
is small enough that stdlib is honestly the right size, and it keeps the fork test to one install.

Adding a provider is one function and one entry in PROVIDERS. It must return the same shape,
including token counts -- lens 05 publishes them and lens 07 prices them, so a provider that
returns no usage cannot be published.
